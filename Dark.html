    <h1>Dark</h1>
    <p>When two children go missing in a small German town, its sinful past is exposed along with the double lives and fractured relationships that exist among four families as they search for the kids.<br>
        The mystery-drama series introduces an intricate puzzle filled with twists that includes a web of curious characters, all of whom have a connection to the town's troubled history -- whether they know it or not.<br>
        The story includes supernatural elements that tie back to the same town in 1986.</p>
        <p><b>"Dark"</b> represents the first German original series produced for Netflix.</p>
